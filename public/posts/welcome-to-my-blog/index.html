            <p>Hi!  I made this blog to talk about my projects and ideas. I&#39;ve had some trouble in the 
            past with being consistent in my output, but I&#39;m hoping things will be different this 
            time around.</p>
            <p>I&#39;m planning on making a lot of posts about the development of Card Magician and other
            tangential projects.  I hope you will find some of what I&#39;ve written interesting or 
            useful.</p>
